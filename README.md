Just 17 hours of time spent on this one sorry for the incompleteness, but it works!

Built using [Phaser.IO](http://phaser.io/) and Node.js

My wife and I got talking about her fav pet (our two bunnies) and how she would make a game about them, she has never played a game since she was 10 so it was great because i was looking for a child's mind (in terms of games) and we came up with this. 

#### AIM: 

Reach enough points to shapeshift into the Roo and earn big points! 

- You get 1 life! 
- Any collisions as the mouse is game over. 
- The Bun enjoys double points and can beat the cat but the fox and car will surely hurt *ouch*. 
- Becoming the Roo earns triple points! 


Works 100% Offline; after initial download. 

My game is best played responsively on Chrome in landscape with keyboard arrow keys (L R U), but i've got the touch/swipe working on several android phones (all i have sorry iPhone owners) but my latest phone (HTC One M8) fails to follow your finger :( more time needed! 

Note for Android users: save to Homescreen first, then launch and play for best full screen experience.

### Run it yourself

If you're keen to run it yourself, ensure you're node and npm engines match the package.json and simply run:

`npm install`

and 

`npm start`

Then visit the url output in the terminal window (including the port number).
